# Computional_Geometry_Library
Computational Geometry library in C# from scratch with GUI and Visualization for the algorithms output
it will be developed as part of my Computational Geometry course at FCIS Ain Shames University
and it will be an on going project as I will add to it every new Algorithm that I will learn.
